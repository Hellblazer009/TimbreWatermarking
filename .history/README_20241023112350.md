## Introduction

- `watermarking_model`: Code of the watermarking model
- `voice.clone`: Code and details of the voice cloning part

:rabbit2: In this repository, we provide the complete code for training and testing the watermarking model. Additionally, we include the source code used for voice cloning experiments under various scenarios, along with corresponding README files. Please visit the respective directories to access detailed READMEs.

## Model files
All the parameter files for the voice cloning model used in our work are available at [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tRbEneN1VsSCZ0HPxG3DSoJdxDRZ_NUJ?usp=drive_link).


## Acknowledgments

Part of our experiments were based on code from several open-source repositories, including [VITS](https://github.com/jaywalnut310/vits), [Tacotron2](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2), [so-vits-svc](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc), [Hifi-GAN](https://github.com/jik876/hifi-gan), and [FastSpeech2](https://github.com/ming024/FastSpeech2). Their code served as a foundation for portions of our experiments.
